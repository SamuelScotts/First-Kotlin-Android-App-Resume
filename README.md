# Trialed Android Studio / Kotlin

Built a small resume app using Android Studio and Kotlin.

In terms of Kotlin, the course taught my the basics the language (variables / loops / functions / lists / arrays / classes etc.).

In terms of the app, I learned how to use buttons to move between activities, and link to the phone / email clients on Andriod devices.

All learning and guidance from 'The Complete Kotlin Developer Course' by Nick Walter and Rob Percival.  Link below.
